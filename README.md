## Contributing

Contributing to an open-source project can be tough, and it can take time to get the hang of things. Don’t hesitate to [file a new issue](https://github.com/fredbey/try_git/issues/new) or join us in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/fredbey/try_git/issues) if anything catches your eye.

By joining our conversations as we weigh the pros and cons of certain approaches, you’ll be better armed to make the same decisions on your *own* projects. If you’re already well-versed in the ways of GitHub we’d love to have your eyes on how we’ll be doing things over the next few weeks, and your help building a welcoming, low-pressure place to learn the ins and outs of contributing to an open source project.
